## Course Overview

This course is designed to give you hands-on experience with building AI agents using different levels of technical complexity. Whether you're a business user, a low-code developer, or a seasoned programmer, there's a path for you.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Build no-code agents using Watsonx Orchestrate
- Create visual agent workflows with Langflow
- Develop sophisticated agents with Langgraph and Python
- Implement proper AI governance and evaluation strategies

## Course Structure

This course is organized into four progressive chapters:

### [Chapter 1: Orchestrate](orchestrate.md)
**No-code agent building with Watsonx Orchestrate**

Perfect for business users and those new to AI agent development. Learn to build powerful agents without writing any code.

### [Chapter 2: Langflow](langflow.md) 
**Visual agent development with drag-and-drop workflows**

The perfect middle ground between no-code simplicity and full programming control. Build complex agents using a visual interface.

### [Chapter 3: Langgraph](langgraph.md)
**Pro-code agent development with Python**

For developers who want complete control. Build sophisticated, production-ready agents with advanced capabilities.

### [Chapter 4: Governance](governance.md)
**AI governance, evaluation, and monitoring**

Essential skills for deploying AI agents responsibly in production environments. Learn evaluation frameworks and monitoring strategies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A basic understanding of AI concepts
- Access to Watsonx services (instructions provided in each section)
- Python 3.11+ installed for the Langgraph section
- Git for cloning the repository
